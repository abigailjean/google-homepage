My first project to demonstrate the various HTML + CSS skills learned so far, plus get familiar with JavaScript.

Walking through the lessons from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css), this will hopefully help brush up on previously learned lessons but also get familiar with using GitHub, too.

This test website will help combine the two new elements that are being worked on (JavaScript & GitHub) while buffing up the front-end knowledge picked up from previous self-taught "projects".
